SLURM Switch Manager
December 19, 2001

XXX - see elan.runtime.requirements.txt for Quadrics information previously
described here.  I believe most of what we had here goes in the partition 
manager and job manager components.  The switch manager should just monitor 
the health of interconnect hardware and be queriable by the rest of SLURM 
before interconnect resources are allocated to a job.  

Details to be worked out, but for example on Quadrics, the switch manager 
would manage the parallel port connection from the management node to the
jtag port on the switch assembly.
