.TH SCONTROL "1" "September 2002" "scontrol 0.1" "Slurm components"

.SH "NAME"
scontrol \- Used view and modify Slurm configuration and state.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBscontrol\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] [\fICOMMAND\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBscontrol\fR is used to view or modify Slurm configuration including: job, 
job step, node, partition, and overall system configuration. Most of the 
commands can only be executed by user root. If an attempt to view or modify 
configuration information is made by an unauthorized user, an error message 
will be printed and the requested action will not occur. If no command is 
entered on the execute line, \fBscontrol\fR will operate in an interactive 
mode and prompt for input. It will continue prompting for input and executing 
commands until explicitly terminated. If a command is entered on the execute 
line, \fBscontrol\fR will execute that command and terminate. All commands 
and options are case-insensitive, although node names and partition names 
are case-sensitive (node names "LX" and "lx" are distinct).

.TP
OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Print a help message describing the usage of scontrol.
.TP
\fB-q\fR
Print no warning or informational messages, only fatal error messages.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Print detailed event logging. This includes time-stamps on data structures, 
record counts, etc.
.TP
COMMAND
.TP
\fIabort\fP
Instruct the Slurm controller to terminate immediately and generate a core file.
.TP
\fIexit\fP
Terminate the execution of scontrol.
.TP
\fIhelp\fP
Display a description of scontrol options and commands.
.TP
\fIquiet\fP
Print no warning or informational messages, only fatal error messages.
.TP
\fIquit\fP
Terminate the execution of scontrol.
.TP
\fIreconfigure\fP
Instruct the Slurm controller to re-read its configuration file. 
This mechanism would be used to register the physical addition or removal of 
nodes from the cluster or recognize the change of a node's configuration, 
such as the addition of memory or processors. Running jobs continue execution.
.TP
\fIshow\fP \fIENTITY\fP \fPID\fP
Display the state of the specified entity with the specified identification.
\fIENTITY\fP may be \fIconfig\fP, \fIjob\fP, \fInode\fP, \fIpartition\fP
or \fIstep\fP.
\fIID\fP can be used to identify a specific element of the identified 
entity: the configuration parameter name, job ID, node name, partition name, 
or job step ID for entities \fIconfig\fP, \fIjob\fP, \fInode\fP, \fIpartition\fP, 
and \fIstep\fP respectively. 
Multiple node names may be specified using simple regular expressions 
(e.g. "lx[10-20]"). All other \fIID\fP values must identify a single 
element. The job step ID is of the form "job_id.step_id", (e.g. "1234.1").
By default, all elements of the entity type specified are printed.
.TP
\fIshutdown\fP
Instruct the Slurm controller to save its current state and terminate.
.TP
\fIupdate\fP \fISPECIFICATION\fP 
Update job, node or partition configuration per the supplied specification.
\fISPECIFICATION\fP is in the same format as the Slurm configuration file 
and the output of the \fIshow\fP command described above. It may be desirable 
to execute the \fIshow\fP command (described above) on the specific entity 
you which to update, then use cut-and-paste tools to enter updated configuration 
values to the \fIupdate\fP. Note that while most configuration values can be 
changed using this command, not all can be changed using this mechanism. In 
particular, the hardware configuration of a node or the physical addition or 
removal of nodes from the cluster may only be accomplished through editing 
the Slurm configuration file and executing the \fIreconfigure\fP command 
(described above).
.TP
\fIverbose\fP
Print detailed event logging. This includes time-stamps on data structures, 
record counts, etc.
.TP
\fIversion\fP
Display the version number of scontrol being executed.
.TP
\fI!!\fP
Repeat the last command executed.
