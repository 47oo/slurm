DESCRIPTION
-----------

This directory contains the select plugin specific for the Bluegene/L
(BGL) machine.  The task of this plugin is to select the appropriate
nodes (base partitions) required for running jobs.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

You may specify the type of bgl partitions that were specified in the
slurm partition file in a bluegene.conf file.  Otherwise, the default
behavior is to sort in decreasing order and try to fit the largest
size partitions as tori.

Each entry in the configuration file is a set of nodes and their
desired type.  The set of nodes must match a set of nodes specified
for a BGL partition from within the SLURM partition.  E.g. for a SLURM
partition entry in slurm.conf:

  PartitionName=batch222 Nodes=bgl[200x311] MinNodes=8 MaxNodes=8
  PartitionName=batch222 Nodes=bgl[220x331] # Add more nodes
  PartitionName=batch222 Nodes=bgl[202x313] # Add more nodes
  PartitionName=batch222 Nodes=bgl[222x333] # Add more nodes

there may be a corresponding BGL partition specification: 

  Nodes=bgl[200x311] Type=Mesh
  Nodes=bgl[220x331] Type=Torus
  Nodes=bgl[202x313] Type=Torus
  Nodes=bgl[222x333] Type=Mesh

Note that the configuration specified in this file may not be
physically possible due to the wiring contraints of the BGL system.  A
tool will be provided that allows an admin to determine what
configurations are feasible.


PROBLEMS --------

If you experience problems compiling, installing, or running this
plugin please send email to either Dan Phung <phung4@llnl.gov> or
