TO BUILD:
  > cd slurm
  > ./autogen.sh
  > ./configure [OPTIONS]
  > make
  > make install  <or> make rpm tag=Head

  OPTIONS:
     "--enable-debug" to run the daemons in debug mode (more validity 
             checking and writes core files, useful for getting things
             running)
     "--prefix=" to specify a directory into which the slurm files are 
             to be installed
     "--sysconfdir=" to specify the directory into which the 
             slurm.conf file is placed
     "--with-elan" to support a Quadics Elan3 interconnect, defaults 
             to IP interconnect
     "--with-totalview" to support the Etnus TotalView debugger

TO TEST:
  You will need to construct a valid configuration file for your machine.
  To run on a single host, you can probably use the file in
    "etc/slurm.conf.localhost" with minimal modifications.  
  For a cluster, you should build something based upon "etc/slurm.conf.dev". 
  Be sure to update "SlurmUser", "JobCredentialPrivateKey" and 
    "JobCredentialPublicCertificate". There are usable keys in
    "src/slurmd/private.key" and "src/slurmd/public.cert". New keys 
    can be built using the following commands:
    "openssl genrsa -out <name of private key> 1024"
    "openssl rsa -in <name of private key> -pubout -out <name of public key>"
  See "doc/man/man5/slurm.conf.5" for help in building this.

  Initiate "slurmctld" on the control machine (it can run without root 
     permissions, see SlurmUser in slurm.conf). For testing purposes you 
     probably want to use several options: "-D" keep in foreground, "-c" 
     clear state from previous executions, and possibly "-v" for verbose 
     messages (more v's for more verbosity). For example: 
     "slurmctld -D -c -vvvvv" (specify pathname as needed).
  Initiate "slurmd" on each compute server (it needs to run as root for 
     production, but can run as a normal user for testing - it will report 
     errors on the initgroups, seteuid, and setegid functions if not run 
     as root, but if everything is run as the same user most functionality
     is OK). For testing purposes you probably want to use several options: 
     "-D" keep in foreground, "-c" clear state from previous executions, 
     and possibly "-v" for verbose messages (more v's for more verbosity). 
     For example "slurmd -D -c -vvvvv". If using pdsh (parallel distributed 
     shell) to initiate slurmd on every node, the execute line would be 
     "pdsh -a "slurmd -D -c -vvvvv"" (specify pathname as needed).
  Run jobs using the "srun" command.
  Get system status using "sinfo" and "squeue".
  Terminate jobs using "scancel".
  Get and set system configuration information using "scontrol".
  Man pages for all of these daemons and commands are available. 

  There DejaGnu scripts to exercise various APIs and tools.

NOTES:
  You should have autoconf version 2.52 or higher (see "autoconf -V").

  There is no authentication of communications between commands and 
     daemons without the the authd daemon in operation. For more 
     information, see "http://www.theether.org/authd/".


STATUS (As of 3/4/2002): 
  Most functionality is in place and working.
  Performance is good (under 5 seconds to run 1900 tasks of "/bin/hostname"
      over 950 nodes). 
  Fault-tolerance is good.
  Support for additional hardware and software is planned in future releases
      (IA64, RedHat 8.1, Myrinet, IBM Blue Gene).
  Support for job suspend/resume and checkpoint/restart is planned for 
      future releases.
