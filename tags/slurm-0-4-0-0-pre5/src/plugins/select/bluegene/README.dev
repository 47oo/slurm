DESCRIPTION
-----------

This file contains some (hopefully) helpful information when modifying
the bluegene select plugin.

Here's the flow of the plugin

init
  doesn't do anything (now, Mon Sep 13 09:54:57 PDT 2004)

select_p_part_init
  reads in bluegene.conf and creates the BGL partitions.

select_p_state_save
  FIXME - saves bluegene state

select_p_state_restore
  FIXME - restores former bluegene state

select_p_node_init
  NO-OP

select_p_job_test
  tests if a partition can satisfy the required resources and assigns
  them accordingly.

select_p_job_init
select_p_job_fini  
  calls CMCS API to initialize/remove job related structures, as
  appropriate.

FIXME - DAN, put more info about what's happening in bluegene.c and
partition_sys here.


PROBLEMS --------

If you experience problems compiling, installing, or running this
plugin please send email to either Dan Phung <phung4@llnl.gov> or
