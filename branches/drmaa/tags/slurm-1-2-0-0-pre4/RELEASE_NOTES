RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 1.2
3 October 2006 (through 1.2.0-pre3)


NEW COMMANDS

* Several new commands have been added to perform individual srun functions.
  The srun command will continue to exist, but these commands may offer 
  greater clarity and ease of use. The srun options --allocate, --attach, 
  and --batch will eventially cease being supported. The new commands are 
  salloc  - Create a job allocation (functions like "srun --allocate")
  sattach - Attach to an existing job step (functions like "srun --attach")
  sbatch  - Submit a batch job script (functions like "srun --batch")
  slaunch - Launch tasks (requires a pre-existing job allocation)
  See the indivual man pages for more information. 

* A new GUI is available for viewing and modifying state information, sview.
  Note that sview will only be built on systems which have libglade-2.0 and 
  gtk+-2.0 installed.


CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES

* The slurm.conf configuration file now supports a "Include" directive to
  include other files inline.

* Added new configuration parameter MessageTimeout (replaces #define in the
  code).

* Added new configuration parameter MailProg (in case mail program is not
  at "/bin/mail").

* Removed defunct configuration parameter, ShedulerAuth. It has been rendered 
  obsolute by the new wiki.conf file.

* Several new configuration parameters can be used to specify architectural
  details of the node: Sockets, CoresPerSocket, and ThreadsPerCore.


OTHER CHANGES

* Several srun options are available to control layout of tasks across the 
  cores on a node: --extra-node-info, --ntasks-per-node, --sockets-per-node,
  --cores-per-socket, --threads-per-core, --minsockets, --mincores, --minthreads,
  --ntasks-per-socket, --ntasks-per-core, and --ntasks-per-node.

* New scontrol, sinfo and squeue options can be used to view socket, core,
  and task details by job and/or node.

* Permit batch jobs to be requeued ("scontrol requeue <jobid>" or
  "srun --batch --no-requeue ..." to prevent).

* View a job's exit code using "scontrol show job".

* Added "account" field to job and step accounting information and sacct output.

* Added new job field, "comment". Set by srun, salloc and sbatch. View
  with "scontrol show job". Used by sched/wiki.

* Added support for OS X operaing system.

* There is a new version of the Wiki scheduler plugin to interface with
  the Maui Scheduler and Moab. It can be accessed with the slurm.conf
  parameter "SchedulerType=sched/wiki2" (it will replace "sched/wiki"
  in SLURM version 1.2, but will co-exist in version 1.1.10+). If you 
  currently use sched/wiki, you will at least need to add a wiki.conf 
  file. Key differences include:
  - Node and job data returned is correct (several errors in old plugin)
  - Node data includes partition information (CCLASS field)
  - Improved error handling
  - Support added for configuration file ("wiki.conf" in same directory
    as "slurm.conf" file, see "man wiki.conf" for details)
  - Support added for job suspend/resume and requeue
  - Authentication of communications now supported
  - Notification of scheduler on events (job submitted or termination)


See the file NEWS for more details.
