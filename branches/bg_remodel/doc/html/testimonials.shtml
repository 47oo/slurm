"Today our largest IBM computers, BlueGene/L and Purple, ranked #1 and #3 
respectively on the November 2005 Top500 list, use SLURM.
This decision reduces large job launch times from tens of minutes to seconds.
This effectivley provides 
us with millions of dollars with of additional compute resources without 
additional cost.  It also allows our computational scientists to use their 
time more effectively.  SLURM is scalable to very large numbers of processors, 
another essential ingredient for use at LLNL. This means larger computer 
systems can be used than otherwise possible with a commensurate increase in 
the scale of problems that can be solved. SLURM's scalability has eliminated 
resource management from being a concern for computers of any foreseeable 
size. It is one of the best things to happin to massively parallel computing."

"We are extremely pleased with SLURM and strongly recommend it to others 
becaus it is mature, the developers are highly responsive and 
"it just works."<br><br>

We adopted SLURM as our resource manager over two years ago when it was at
the 0.3.x release level. Since then it has become an integral and important
component of our production research services. Its stability, flexibility
and performance has allowed us to significantly increase the quality of
experience we offer to our researchers."<br><br>

"SLURM is the coolest thing since the invention of UNIX...
We now can control who can log into [compute nodes] or at least can control
which ones to allow logging into.  This will be a tremendous help for users
who are developing their apps."<br><br>

"SLURM is a great product that I'd recommend to anyone setting up a cluster,
or looking to reduce their costs by abandoning an existing commercial
resource manager."<br><br>

"SLURM is under active development, is easy to use, works quite well, 
and most important to your harried author, it hasn't been a nightmare 
to configure or manage. (Strong praise, that.) I would range SLURM as 
the best of the three open source batching systems available, by rather 
a large margin." <br><br>

"SLURM has been adopted as the parallel allocation infrastructure used 
in HP's premier cluster stack, XC System Software. SLURM has permitted 
easy scaling of parallel applications on custer systems with thousands
of processors, and has also proven itself to be highly portable and 
efficient between interconnects icluding Quadrics, QsNet, Myrinet, 
Infiniband and Gigabit Ethernet."
