IMPORTANT NOTE: (This may not apply, check back later)
SLURM state files in version 1.3 are different from those of version 1.2.
After installing SLURM version 1.2, plan to restart without preserving 
jobs or other state information. Restart daemons with the "-c" option or 
use "/etc/init.d/slurm startclean".
