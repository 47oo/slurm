TO BUILD:
./autogen.sh
./configure
make


TO TEST:
cd src/slurmctld
./slurmctld &		# start the controller

cd ../api
./node_info		# get node info
./partition_info	# get partition info
etc...


NOTES:
The machines lx##.llnl.gov have an old version of libtool. 
	To build there, execute "./autogen.sh" on linux.llnl.gov, 
	then "./configure" and "make" on lx##.llnl.gov.
The smurf##.llnl.gov systems have an old version of libtool
	and gcc in an unusual location. To build there, execute 
	"./autogen.sh" on linux.llnl.gov. Then prepend 
	"/opt/freeware/GNUPro/bin/gcc" to your path or configure with
	"CC=/opt/freeware/GNUPro/bin/gcc ./configure" and 
	execute "gmake" rather than the AIX "make" program.
