TO BUILD:
  cd slurm
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make


TO TEST:
  cd slurm/src/slurmctld
  ./slurmctld		# start the controller

Submit jobs and exercise the other APIs using the DejaGnu scripts
  cd slurm/testsuite/slurm_unit/api/manual
  make
  ./submit-tst [number of jobs]
  ./allocate-tst [number of jobs]
  ./update_config-tst
  ./reconfigure-tst
  ./cancel-tst [job_id]

You can also use the tools scontrol, squeue, and scancel.
These tools are in sub-directories of "slurm/src". 
All of these tools also have man pages in "slurm/doc/man".
The job initiation tool srun is not quite ready for use (as of 7/22/2002)

NOTES:
You should have autoconf version 2.52 or higher (see "autoconf -V").
