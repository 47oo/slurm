TO BUILD:
  cd slurm
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make [--with-authd] [--with-elan] [--with-totalview] 
  /* --with-authd if you want to use authd for authentication */
  /* --with-elan  if you have an Quadics elan switch, defaults to IP */
  /* --with-totalview  if you want to support the Etnus TotalView debugger */

TO TEST:
  You will need to construct a valid configuration file for your machine.
  To run on a single host, you can use the file etc/slurm.conf. For a 
  cluster, you should build something based upon etc/slurm.conf.dev. 
  See doc/man/man5/slurm.conf.5 for help in building this.

  Initiate slurmctld on the control machine (it can run without root 
  permissions, as user SlurmUser as set in slurm.conf).
  Initiate slurmd on each host (needs to run as root for production, 
  but can run as a normal user for testing).
  Run jobs using the srun command.
  Get system status using scontrol, sinfo, squeue.
  Terminate jobs using scancel.
  These daemons and commands are in sub-directories of "slurm/src". 

  There DejaGnu scripts to exercise various APIs and tools (they need 
  more work.

NOTES:
  You should have autoconf version 2.52 or higher (see "autoconf -V").

STATUS (As of 11/26/2002): 
  Basic functionality is in place, although development work is required
  in various areas. 
  The code is not ready for production use yet.
  Documentation needs updating, although the man pages are in pretty 
  good shape.
  Scaling studies are needed. 
  Send feedback to Morris Jette <jette1@llnl.gov> and Mark Grondona
  <grondona1@llnl.gov>.
