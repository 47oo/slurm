TO BUILD:
  > cd slurm
  > ./autogen.sh
  > ./configure [--with-authd] [--with-elan] [--with-totalview]
  > make

  NOTES:
     # --with-authd if you want to use authd for authentication
     # --with-elan  if you have an Quadics elan switch, defaults to IP
     # --with-totalview  if you want to support the Etnus TotalView debugger

TO TEST:
  You will need to construct a valid configuration file for your machine.
  To run on a single host, you can probably use the file in
    "etc/slurm.conf.localhost" with minimal modifications.  
  For a cluster, you should build something based upon "etc/slurm.conf.dev". 
  Be sure to update "SlurmUser", "JobCredentialPrivateKey" and 
    "JobCredentialPublicCertificate". There are keys in
    "src/slurmd/private.key" and "src/slurmd/public.cert"
  See "doc/man/man5/slurm.conf.5" for help in building this.

  Initiate "src/slurmctld/slurmctld" on the control machine (it can run 
     without root permissions, as user SlurmUser as specified in slurm.conf).
  Initiate "src/slurmd/slurmd" on each compute server (it needs to run 
     as root for production, but can run as a normal user for testing - 
     it will report errors on the initgroups, seteuid, and setegid functions 
     if not run as root).
  Run jobs using the "src/srun/srun" command.
  Get system status using "src/sinfo/sinfo" and "src/squeue/squeue".
  Terminate jobs using "src/scancel/scancel".
  Get and set system configuration information using "src/scontrol/scontrol".
  Man pages for all of these daemons and commands can be found in "doc/man". 

  There DejaGnu scripts to exercise various APIs and tools (they need 
     more work).

NOTES:
  You should have autoconf version 2.52 or higher (see "autoconf -V").
  There is no authentication of communications between commands and 
     daemons without the the authd daemon in operation. For more 
     information, see "http://www.theether.org/authd/".

STATUS (As of 12/19/2002): 
  Most functionality is in place and working.
  Performance is good (under 5 seconds to run 1900 tasks of "/bin/hostname"
      over 950 nodes). 
  Numerous performance enhancements are in the works as well as support
      for the TotalView debugger and pluggable authentication modules (PAM).
  Send feedback to Morris Jette <jette1@llnl.gov> and Mark Grondona
