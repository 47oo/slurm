- be able to translate out the geometry
- add trace of coordinates into structures

- use symmetry of wiring to reduce size of problem.

- add table to store results
  > partition sizes, geometery, coordinates?, torus/non-torus

- add functionality to query table
- input/output of 
  > static wiring
  > mark certain nodes as down

done- add permutations of switch with only 2 or 1 wire(s).
done- add complexity of another dimension.

done- how to indicate that a partition is toridal vs mesh?
  > brute force: traverse it
done > smarter -> keep track of non-toridal conns.  if none = torus.

done - switch to smarter graph checking (flexing) implementation.

done - if merging, remember to change all the internal connections
of the node to be the new label (ID)
