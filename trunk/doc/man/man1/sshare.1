.TH SSHARE "12" "November 2008" "sshare 1.4.0-pre4" "Slurm components"

.SH "NAME"
sshare \- Tool for listing the shares of associations to a cluster.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsshare\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] [\fICOMMAND\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsshare\fR is used to view Slurm share information.
The share information is maintained within a database with the interface 
being provided by \fBslurmdbd\fR (Slurm Database daemon).
This database can serve as a central storehouse of user and 
computer information for multiple computers at a single site.
Slurm account information is recorded based upon four parameters
that form what is referred to as an \fIassociation\fR. 
These parameters are \fIuser\fR, \fIcluster\fR, \fIpartition\fR, and 
\fIaccount\fR. \fIuser\fR is the login name.
\fIcluster\fR is the name of a Slurm managed cluster as specified by 
the \fIClusterName\fR parameter in the \fIslurm.conf\fR configuration file. 
\fIpartition\fR is the name of a Slurm partition on that cluster.
\fIaccount\fR is the bank account for a job.
