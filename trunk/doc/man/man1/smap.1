.TH SMAP "1" "November 2004" "smap 0.4" "Slurm components"

.SH "NAME"
smap \- graphically view information about SLURM jobs, partitions, and set 
configurations parameters.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsmap\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsmap\fR is used to graphically view job, partition and node information 
for a system running SLURM. 

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR,
Print a message describing all \fBsmap\fR options.
.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Print a brief message listing the \fBsmap\fR options.
.TP
\fB\-D <option>\fR, \fB\-\-display=<option>\fR
sets the display mode for smap. Showing revelant information about specific 
views and displaying a corresponding 3 dimentional node chart. While in any 
display a user can switch by typing a different view letter.  This is true in
all modes except for 'configure mode' user can type 'quit' to exit just 
configure mode.  Typing 'exit' will end the configuration mode and exit smap.
.RS
.TP 15
.I "j"
Displays information about jobs running on system.
.TP 
.I "s"
Displays information about slurm partitions on the system
.TP
.I "b"
Displays information about BGL partitions on the system
.TP
.I "c"
Displays current node states and allows users to configure the system.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-noheader\fR
Do not print a header on the output.
.TP
\fB\-i <seconds>\fR , \fB\-\-iterate=<seconds>\fR
Print the state on a periodic basis. 
Sleep for the indicated number of seconds between reports.
User can exit at anytime by typing 'q' or hitting the return key.
If user is in configure mode type 'exit' to exit program, 'quit' 
to exit configure mode.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR , \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information and exit.

.SH "OUTPUT FIELD DESCRIPTIONS"
.TP
\fBAVAIL\fR
Partition state: \fBup\fR or \fBdown\fR.
\fBTIMELIMIT\fR
Maximum time limit for any user job in
days:hours:minutes:seconds.  \fBinfinite\fR is used to identify
partitions without a job time limit.
.TP
\fBNODELIST\fR
Names of nodes associated with this configuration/partition.
.TP
\fBNODES\fR
Count of nodes with this particular configuration.
.TP
.TP
\fBPARTITION\fR
Name of a partition.  Note that the suffix "*" identifies the
default partition.
.TP
\fBSTATE\fR
State of the nodes. Possible states include: down, unknown,
idle, allocated, drained, draining, completing and their
abbreviated forms: down, unk, idle, alloc, drain, drng, and
comp respectively.  Note that the suffix "*" identifies nodes
that are presently not responding.
.TP

.SH "NODE STATE CODES"
.PP
Node state codes are shortened as required for the field size.
If the node state code is followed by "*", this indicates the
node is presently not responding and will not be allocated
any new work.  If the node remains non-responsive, it will
be placed in the \fBDOWN\fR state (except in the case of
\fBDRAINED\fR, \fBDRAINING\fR, or \fBCOMPLETING\fR nodes).
.TP 12
ALLOCATED
The node has been allocated to one or more jobs.
.TP
COMPLETING
One or more jobs have been allocated this node and are in
the process of COMPLETING. This node state will be removed when
all of the job's processes have terminated and the SLURM
epilog program (if any) has terminated. See the \fBEpilog\fR
parameter description in the \fBslurm.conf\fR man page for
more information.
.TP
DOWN
The node is unavailable for use. SLURM can automatically
place nodes in this state if some failure occurs. System
administrators may also explicitly place nodes in this state. If
a node resumes normal operation, SLURM can automatically
return it to service. See the \fBReturnToService\fR
and \fBSlurmdTimeout\fR parameter descriptions in the
\fBslurm.conf\fR(5) man page for more information.
.TP
DRAINED
The node is unavailable for use per system administrator
request.  See the \fBupdate node\fR command in the
\fBscontrol\fR(1) man page or the \fBslurm.conf\fR(5) man page
for more information.
.TP
DRAINING
The node is currently executing a job, but will not be allocated
to additional jobs. The node state will be changed to state
\fBDRAINED\fR when the last job on it completes. Nodes enter
this state per system administrator request. See the \fBupdate
node\fR command in the \fBscontrol\fR(1) man page or the
\fBslurm.conf\fR(5) man page for more information.
.TP
IDLE
The node is not allocated to any jobs and is available for use.
.TP
UNKNOWN
The SLURM controller has just started and the node's state
has not yet been determined.
