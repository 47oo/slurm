.SH "NAME"
gres.conf \- Slurm configuration file for generic resource management.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fB/etc/gres.conf\fP is an ASCII file which describes the configuration
of generic resources on each compute node. Each node must contain a
gres.conf file if generic resources are to be scheduled by SLURM.
The file location can be modified at system build time using the
DEFAULT_SLURM_CONF parameter. The file will always be located in the
same directory as the \fBslurm.conf\fP file.
.LP
Parameter names are case insensitive.
Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line.
The size of each line in the file is limited to 1024 characters.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of
SLURM daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution
of the command "scontrol reconfigure" unless otherwise noted.
.LP
The overall configuration parameters available include:

.TP
\fBCount\fR
Number of resources of this type available on this node.
The default value is one.

.TP
\fBCPUs\fR
Specify the CPU index numbers for the specific CPUs which can
use this resources. For example, it may be strongly preferable
to use specific CPUs with specific devices (e.g. on a NUMA
architecture). Multiple CPUs may be specified using a comma
delimited list. If not specified, then any CPU can be used with
the resources.

.TP
\fBFile\fR
Fully qualified pathname of the device file associated with a resource.
This field is generally required if enforcement of generic resource
allocations is to be supported (i.e. prevents a users from making
use of resources allocated to a different user. If specified then
\fBCount\fR must be one.

.TP
\fBName\fR
Name of the generic resource. Each generic resource has an
optional plugin which can provide resource\-specific options.
Currently supported generic resource names include
.RS
.TP
\fBgpu\fR
Graphics Processing Unit
.TP
\fBnic\fR
Network Interface Card
