Job Submission

Jobs will be submitted via an API with an execution specification 
which is expected to be constructed by a front-end program (e.g. 
prun or poe). The specification contains the following fields:

Name       The name of the user submitting the job (required)
Partition  The name of the partition on which the job should execute (optional)
Time       Maximum execution period of the job. This execution may be 
           provided in more than one piece via gang scheduling (job preemption). 
           The default value is unlimited, which is indicated with a value of -1.
CPUs       Count of CPUs desired, default value is 1
Nodes      Explicit comma separated list of desired nodes. This is optional. 
           If specified, the CPUs parameter will be computed and all partition  
           configuration specifications must still be satisfied. These nodes need  
           not be in a single partition.
JobType    INTERACTIVE or BATCH (required)
