\begin{abstract}
Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is an open source,
fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job 
scheduling system for Linux clusters of 
thousands of nodes.  Components include machine status, partition
management, job management, and scheduling modules.  The design also 
includes a scalable, general-purpose communication infrastructure.
Development will take place in four phases:  Phase I results in a solid
infrastructure;  Phase II produces a functional but limited interactive 
job initiation capability without use of the interconnect/switch; 
Phase III provides switch support and documentation; Phase IV provides 
job statusing, fault-tolerance, and job queueing and control through  
Livermore's Distributed Production Control System (DPCS), a metabatch and
resource management system.

\section{Overview}

SLURM\footnote{A tip of the hat to Matt Groening and creators of {\em Futurama},
where Slurm is the highly addictive soda-like beverage made from worm
excrement.} (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) 
is a resource managment 
system suitable for use on Linux clusters, large and small.  After 
surveying\cite{Jette2002} resource managers available for Linux and finding 
none that were simple, highly scalable, and portable to different cluster 
architectures and interconnects, the authors set out to design a new system.

The result is a resource management system with the following general
characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Simplicity}: SLURM is simple enough to allow motivated end users
to understand its source code and add functionality.  The authors will 
avoid the temptation to add features unless they are of general appeal.

\item {\em Open Source}: SLURM is available to everyone and will remain free;
its source code is distributed under the GNU General Public License.

\item {\em Portability}: SLURM is written in the C language, with a GNU 
autoconf configuration engine.  While initially written for Linux, 
other UNIX-like operating systems should be easy porting targets.

\item {\em Interconnect independence}: Initially, SLURM supports TCP/IP based
communication and the Quadrics Elan3 interconnect.  Adding support for other
interconnects is straightforward.  Users select the supported interconnects
at compile time via GNU autoconf.

\item {\em Scalability}: SLURM is designed for scalability to clusters of
thousands of nodes.\footnote{It is anticipiated that a Linux cluster of
size $>1000$ nodes will be available for testing before the initial public 
release.}

\item {\em Fault tolerence}: SLURM can handle a variety of failure modes
without terminating workloads, including crashes of the node running the SLURM
controller.

\item {\em Secure}: SLURM employs crypto technology to authenticate 
users to services and services to services.  
A Kerberos V / DCE infrastructure can be utillized if available.
SLURM does not assume that its networks are physically secure.

\item {\em System administrator friendly}: SLURM is configured with a few
simple configuration files and minimizes distributed state.  Its interfaces
are scriptable and its behavior is highly deterministic.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{What is SLURM?}

As a cluster resource manager, SLURM has three key functions.  First,
it allocates exclusive access to resources (compute nodes) to users for 
some duration of time so they can perform work.  Second, it provides 
a framework for starting up, executing, and monitoring work (normally a 
parallel job) on the set of allocated nodes.  Finally, it arbitrates 
conflicting requests for resources by managing batch queues.

Users interact with SLURM through three command line utilities: 
{\tt srun} for submitting a job for execution and optionally controlling it
interactively; 
{\tt scancel} for early termination of a job; 
and {\tt squeue} for monitoring queues.

System administrators perform priviledged operations through an additional
command line utility: {\tt slurmadmin}.

External schedulers and metabatch systems can submit jobs to SLURM and
order its queues through an application programming interface (API).

Compute nodes simply run a {\tt slurmd} daemon (similar to a remote shell 
daemon) to export control to SLURM.  The central controller daemon,
{\tt slurmctld}, maintains the global state and directs operations.

\subsection{What SLURM is Not}

SLURM is not a sophisticated batch system.  Its default scheduler
implements FIFO with backfill and does not include the bells and 
whistles needed to implement complex site policy.
SLURM does however provide a sufficiently sophisticated API for an external 
scheduler or metabatch system to order its queues based on site policy.

SLURM is not a gang scheduler and does not support time sharing of compute
nodes.  SLURM clusters are space shared, and parallel jobs are always 
assigned whole nodes.  SLURM will not preempt an executing job to run a 
higher priority one (since it has no concept of priorities), but it is 
possible for an external scheduler to terminate jobs and requeue them in a 
different order via the API.

SLURM is not a metabatch system like Globus or DPCS (Distributed Production 
Control System).  SLURM supports resource management across a single cluster.

SLURM is not a comprehensive cluster administration or monitoring package.  
While SLURM knows the state of its compute nodes, it makes no attempt to put
this information to use in other ways, such as with a general purpose event
logging mechanism or a back-end database for recording historical state.
It is expected that SLURM will be deployed in a cluster along side other 
tools that perform these functions. 

\subsection{Architecture}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centerline{\epsfig{file=arch.eps}}
\caption{SLURM Architecture}
\label{arch}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centerline{\epsfig{file=LCM.arch.eps,scale=0.5}}
\caption{SLURM Architecture - Subsystems}
\label{archdetail}
\end{figure}


As depicted in Figure~\ref{arch}, SLURM consists of 
a {\tt slurmd} daemon running on each compute node, 
a central {\tt slurmctld} daemon running on a management node (with optional 
failover twin), 
and a four command line utilities: {\tt srun}, {\tt scancel}, {\tt squeue}, 
and {\tt slurmadmin}, which can run anywhere in the cluster.
A scalable communications library ties these components together.

Figure~\ref{archdetail} exposes the subsystems that are implemented within
the {\tt slurmd} and {\tt slurmctld} daemons.  These subsystems are explained
in more detail below.

\marginpar{Moe - could you update figure~\ref{archdetail} to move
switch manager to controller, add stream copy service to slurmd, and
change job management to process manager in slurmd?  Thanks --JG}  

\subsubsection{Slurmd}

The {\tt slurmd} running
on each compute node can be compared to a remote shell daemon:  it waits 
for work, executes the work, returns status, then waits for more work.  
It also asynchronously exchanges node and job status with the controller.  
It never communicates with other compute nodes and the only job information 
it has at any given time pertains to the currently executing job, if any.

{\tt slurmd} reads its configuration from a file: {\tt /etc/slurmd.conf}
and has three major components:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Machine and Job Status Service}:  Respond to controller 
requests for machine and job state information, and send asynchronous 
reports of some state changes (e.g. {\tt slurmd} startup, process 
termination) to the controller.
Job status includes accounting information which may be required by
an external metabatch system such as DPCS.

\item{\em Process Manager}:  Start, monitor, and clean up after
a set of processes belonging to a parallel job, as dictated by the
controller.  Starting a process may include executing a prolog script, 
setting process limits, setting real and effective
user id, setting environment, setting current working directory, allocating 
interconnect resources, setting core paths, and managing process groups.  
Terminating a process may include terminating all members of a process 
group, and executing an epilog script.

\item{\em Stream Copy Service}:  Allow stderr/stdout/stdin and core files
to be copied in and out of the spool directory for a job.  In the case
of batch jobs, this will happen during startup and cleanup only and will
occur between the controller and {\tt slurmd}'s.
In the case of interactive jobs, stdout/stderr may additionally be ``carbon 
copied'' to the {\tt srun} command during job execution.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Controller}

Most SLURM state exists in the controller, {\tt slurmctld}. 
When {\tt slurmctld} starts, it reads its configuration from a file:
{\tt /etc/slurmctld.conf}.  It also can read additional state from a 
checkpoint file left over from a previous {\tt slurmctld}.
{\tt slurmctld} runs in either master or standby mode, depending
on the state of its failover twin, if any.  

{\tt slurmctld} performs several tasks simultaneously:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Machine Status Manager}: Monitor the state of each 
node in the cluster.  Poll {\tt slurmd}'s for status periodically, and 
receive state change notifications from {\tt slurmd}'s asynchronously.
Notify the partition manager when nodes change state.
{\tt slurmadmin} may be used to set set nodes administratively to 
{\em up}, {\em down}, or {\em drain} status.

\item {\em Partition Manager}:  Manage partition membership, partition
status ({\tt slurmadmin} may be used to set
partitions to {\em up}, {\em down}, or {\em drain} status), and
act as a resource allocator for the job manager, where the resources 
are whole nodes.  The partition manager also interacts with the machine 
status manager to maintain an accurate notion of what resources it has 
available.

\item {\em Scheduler}: Determine the order in which jobs are executed.
When jobs are first submitted, they are placed in the job queue and the 
scheduler is called to perform any reordering of the queue dictated by 
its policy.  The default scheduler implements FIFO with backfill.
The default may be replaced with an external scheduler which implements
other policies.  

\item {\em Job Manager}:  Manage the job queue.
The job manager is awakened whenever there is a change in state that 
might permit a job to begin running, such as job completion, job submission, 
partition {\em up} transition, or node {\em up} transition.
When awakened, the job manager makes one pass through the job queue and
performs any cleanup associated with completed jobs.
The job manager then makes a second pass through the job queue and
starts jobs until a partition manager resource allocation fails.
On allocation failure, the job manager goes back to sleep.

\item {\em Job Status Manager}:
Poll {\tt slurmd}'s on compute nodes that are running jobs.
When the job status manager detects that one or more nodes have completed 
their work, it initiates cleanup by marking the job as {\em completed} 
and awakening the job manager.  The job status manager is closely related to
the machine status manager.

\item {\em Switch Manager}:  Monitor the state of interconnect links 
and inform the machine status manager of any compute nodes whose links
have failed.  The switch manager can be configured
to use Simple Network Monitoring Protocol (SNMP) to obtain link
information from SNMP-capable network hardware.
The switch manager configuration is optional;  without one, 
SLURM simply ignores link errors.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Command Line Utilities}

The command line utilities primarily interact with the controller.
The utilities find the host:port of the controller by reading a configuration 
file: {\tt /etc/slurm.conf}.
They authenticate to the controller using a method selected at compile
time, initially either Kerberos V or ...?

\marginpar{Chris help me out here on the authentication --JG}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt srun}: Submit a job for execution.  {\tt srun} may run in either
interactive or batch mode.  {\tt srun}'s standard input (if it is a file) is 
copied to the controller, which copies it to {\tt slurmd}'s\footnote{{\tt srun}
command line options select the stdin handling method such as broadcast to 
all tasks, or send only to task 0.}
After job submission, batch {\tt srun} terminates, while interactive 
{\tt srun} establishes connections with {\tt slurmd}'s to get standard output 
and error of the tasks in real time, and responds to signals from the 
user.\footnote{From the controller's point of view there is no difference 
between batch and interactive jobs;  an interactive {\tt srun} may detach from 
its job, leaving it to continue running as though submitted in batch mode.
It is also possible for {\tt srun} to attach to a job interactively that
was submitted in batch mode, subject to authentication.}

\item {\tt squeue}: Display the queue of running and waiting jobs.

\item {\tt scancel}: Cancel a running or a waiting job, subject to
authentication.

\item {\tt slurmadmin}: Perfrom priviledged administrative commands
such as draining a partition in preparation for maintenance, or cancelling
jobs.  Must be run as the root user.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Communications Layer}

{\em Does the communications layer need to handle stdout/stderr streams?
If these only apply to an interactive run, can we live with TCP?
TCP may also be appropriate for the copying of stdout/stderr/stdin/core
at the beginning and end of a job.  If that requirement is lifted,
the comm layer design over UDP is simpler.}

\subsection{Example:  Executing a Batch Job}

A user wishes to run a job in batch mode, in which {\tt srun} will return 
immediately and the job will execute ``in the background'' when resources
are available.

The job is a two-node run of {\em mping}, a simple MPI application.
The user submits the job:
\begin{verbatim}
srun --batch --nodes 2 --nprocs 2 1 mping 1 1048576
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt srun} command authenticates the user to the controller and submits
the job request.  As stdin is not a file, it is not copied to the controller.
The request includes the {\tt srun} environment, current working directory, 
and command line option information.

The controller consults the partition manager to test whether the job will
will ever be able to run.  If the user has requested a nonexistant partition,
more nodes than are configured in the partition, a nonexistant constraint, 
etc., the partition manager returns an error and the request is discarded.
The failure is reported to {\tt srun} which tells the user and exits:
\begin{verbatim}
srun: request will never run
\end{verbatim}

On successful submission, the controller assigns the job a unique 
{\em batch id}, adds it to the job queue and returns the 
batch id to {\tt srun}, which reports this to user and exits, returning
success to the user's shell:

\begin{verbatim}
srun: tinymem-42
\end{verbatim}

The controller calls the scheduler to reorder the batch queue and awakens the 
job manager.
The job manager scans for completed jobs, finds none, then tries to run
jobs starting at the head of the job queue.  It finds {\em tinymem-42}
and makes a successful request to the partition manager to allocate 
two nodes from the {\em tinymem} partition: {\em dev6} and {\em dev7}.

The job manager sends a copy of the environment, current working directory,
command path, command arguments, interconnect info, etc.
to the {\tt slurmd}'s running on {\em dev6} and {\em dev7}.  
The {\tt slurmd}'s set up the environment and execute the command as 
the submitting user.  Stdout and stderr are redirected to files on the 
compute nodes:

\begin{verbatim}
/var/spool/slurm/tinymem-42/stdout.[mpirank]
/var/spool/slurm/tinymem-42/stderr.[mpirank]
\end{verbatim}

The job manager notifies the job status manager that a new job is running,
continues to try to run jobs until it cannot, then sleeps.
Meanwhile, on {\em dev6}, {\tt /var/spool/slurm/tinymem-42/stdout.0}
accumulates the application's output:

\begin{verbatim}
  1 pinged   0:        1 bytes      5.38 uSec     0.19 MB/s                     
  1 pinged   0:        2 bytes      5.32 uSec     0.38 MB/s                     
  1 pinged   0:        4 bytes      5.27 uSec     0.76 MB/s                     
  1 pinged   0:        8 bytes      5.39 uSec     1.48 MB/s                     
  ...
  1 pinged   0:  1048576 bytes   4682.97 uSec   223.91 MB/s              
\end{verbatim}

When the tasks complete, the {\tt slurmd}'s on the two compute nodes notify
the job status manager, which changes the job status to {\em complete} and 
awakens the job manager.  The job manager discovers the completed job in
its first pass through the queue and begins cleanup.
First it ensures that all tasks have completed by telling the {\tt slurmd}'s
to terminate the job if it is still running.
Next it retrieves the stdout/stderr spool files from the stream copy service
of each {\tt slurmd} and merges them into a single report, 
which it stores in the user's {\tt srun} directory.

Finally, the job manager frees resources back to the partition manager and
the job is removed from the job queue.

\subsection{Example:  Executing an Interactive Job}

A user wishes to run the same job in interactive mode, in which {\tt srun}
will block while the job executes and stdout/stderr of the job will be 
copied onto stdout/stderr of {\tt srun}.

The user submits the job, this time requesting an interactive run:
\begin{verbatim}
srun --nodes 2 --nprocs 2 1 mping 1 1048576
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt srun} command authenticates the user to the controller and 
executes the same steps described in the batch example, except {\tt srun} 
does not terminate on successful submission.  Instead, it receives a list of
hostnames and a {\em nonce} used to authenticate to the {\tt slurmd}'s.
After the job startup, {\tt srun} has no further interaction with the 
controller.

{\tt srun} then opens connections to the {\tt slurmd}'s and copies 
stdout/stderr of each task to stdout/stderr of {\tt srun}.  These streams
are also spooled on the node and will be collected, merged, and stored
in the user's {\tt srun} directory on completion.

The user sees the output of task 0 on stdout of {\tt srun}:

\begin{verbatim}
  1 pinged   0:        1 bytes      5.38 uSec     0.19 MB/s                     
  1 pinged   0:        2 bytes      5.32 uSec     0.38 MB/s                     
  1 pinged   0:        4 bytes      5.27 uSec     0.76 MB/s                     
  1 pinged   0:        8 bytes      5.39 uSec     1.48 MB/s                     
  ...
  1 pinged   0:  1048576 bytes   4682.97 uSec   223.91 MB/s              
\end{verbatim}

When the job terminates, {\tt srun} receives an EOF on each stream and
closes them, gets the job exit status from {\tt slurmd}'s, and terminates.

If a signal is received by {\tt srun} while the job is executing (for example,
a SIGINT resulting from a Control-C), it is sent to each {\tt slurmd} which 
terminates the individual tasks and reports this to the job status manager,
which cleans up the job.

\marginpar{This is as far as I got in the ``big picture'' update --JG}

\section{Controller Design}


The controller includes the following subsystems:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Machine and job status}: Monitor and record the state of each 
node in the cluster.

\item {\em Partition management}: Distinct functionality or capabilities 
are associated with different sets of nodes in the cluster.  Each such set 
of nodes is considered a partition. 

\item {\em Job management}: Accept, initiate, delete and otherwise manage 
the state of all jobs in the system.

\item {\em Scheduling}: Decide when and where to initiate pending jobs.

\item {\em Switch management}: Perform any interconnect-related 
monitoring and control needed to run a parallel job.

\end{itemize}

Each of these subsystems is described in detail below.

\subsection{Machine Status}

One SLURM daemon will be required on each node in the cluster.
One module of that daemon will monitor its state.
While existing tools can be combined for machine status and management, such an
arrangement lacks the scalability required for the support of thousands of
nodes. We believe this poses serious problems in the management of large Linux
clusters and feel compelled to address this issue. 

We recognize the severe impact system daemons can have on performance of
parallel jobs, so the compute and memory resources consumed by this daemon
should be minimized. In phase three, we intend for this service to also monitor
basic job state information. In phase four, this will be expanded to include 
job accounting information. Providing all functions
within a single daemon will minimize system overhead. Node information that we
intend to monitor includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item Count of processors on the node
\item Size of real memory on the node
\item Size of temporary disk storage
\item Partition(s) serving
\item State of node (RUN, IDLE, DRAIN, etc.)
\item Cumulative CPU use (by job, kernel and daemons, possibly reporting 
both user and system time independently)
\item Allocated CPU time (recognizes preempted time, by job, kernel and daemons)
\item Real memory demand (by job, kernel and daemons)
\end{itemize}

The SLURM administrator could specify, at a minimum ,a list of system node 
names using a regular expression. 
If he requires more than one partition, that information should also be specified. 
He may also specify the mimimanl node configuration values which are acceptable 
(CPU count, real memory size, etc.). He could alternately let the individual 
nodes register their actual configurations into the database and save that 
as a baseline configuration in order to note discrepancies when nodes register 
on future SLURM initiations.

This information is readily available through system calls and reading the
process table. DPCS daemons and the commands \textit{top} and \textit{df} 
currently collect the above data are available as models for SLURM development. 
The communications protocols in those daemon and logic to associate processes 
with jobs would require modification.

The current SLURM design only supports the allocation of entire nodes to 
jobs. Our customers at LLNL have expressed the opinion that sharing of 
nodes can severely reduce their job's performance and even reliability. 
This is due to contention for shared resources such as local disk space, 
real memory, virtual memory and processor cycles. The proper support of 
shared resources, including the enforcement of limits on these resources, 
entails a substantial amount of additional effort. Given such a cost to 
benefit situation at LLNL, we have decided to not support shared nodes. 
However, we have designed SLURM so as to not preclude the addition of 
such a capability at a later time if so desired.

It is not likely that each node in the cluster could report such information
directly to the control machine without severe scalability constraints. This
could be remedied by using intermediate nodes in a hierarchical fashion to
coalesce the data. These nodes could be ones not designated for parallel job
execution (e.g. login or I/O processing nodes). A status manager will be
required on the control machine to detect and respond to anomalies as well as
maintain the records. This data collection system is similar to that
implemented in DPCS. 

\subsection{Partition Management}

Partition management will be used to identify groups of nodes to be used for
execution of user jobs. Data to be associated with a partition will include:
\begin{itemize}
\item ID number
\item Access permitted, under direct user (e.g. INTERACTIVE) or system (e.g. BATCH QUEUE) control
\item List of associated nodes
\item State of partition (UP or DOWN)
\end{itemize}

It will be possible to alter this data in real-time in order to effect the
scheduling of pending jobs (currently executing jobs would continue). Unlike some
other parallel job management systems, we believe this information can be
confined to the SLURM control machine for better scalability. It would be used
by the Job Manager and Machine Status Manager, which exist only on the control
machine. An API to manage the partitions would be developed first, followed by
a simple command-line tool utilizing the API.

\subsection{Switch Management}

A daemon on each compute node would be responsible for allocating switch
channels and assigning them to user jobs. The switch channels would be
de-allocated upon job termination. Switch health monitoring tools will 
also be implemented in phase two. It may be desirable for the SLURM daemons to use the
switch directly for communications, particularly for the movement of a large 
executable and/or standard input file. This option will be investigated in phase
three. 

\subsection{Job Management}

Jobs will be allocated entire nodes. Node sharing will be supported only temporally (e.g.
time-slicing or  gang scheduling). The core functions to be supported include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Initiate job\footnote{There are considerable issues regarding allocation 
of resources (nodes) to jobs and then associating the  allocation to the job 
as well as relinquishing the allocation at job termination that we need to 
discuss. - Bob Wood}
\item Will job run query (test if "Initiate job" request would succeed)
\item Status job (including node list, memory and CPU use data)
\item Signal job for termination (following DPCS model of explicit application
registration)
\item Terminate job (remove all processes)
\item Preempt/resume job 
\item Checkpoint/restart job (future)
\item Change node count of running job (could fail if insufficient resources are 
available, future)
\end{itemize}

Submitted jobs can specify desired partition, CPU count, node count, task 
count, task distribution pattern (round-robin or sequential within a node), 
and (optionally) an explicit list of nodes. The submitted job will be 
identified as being initiated under direct user (e.g. INTERACTIVE) or system 
(e.g. BATCH QUEUE) control, and by virtue of this can be constrained 
to specific partitions. 

Since scheduling decisions are being provided by the scheduling component,
there is no concept of submitting a job to be queued in the initial SLURM design. 
The concept of gang scheduling, or time-slicing for parallel jobs, is supported by the preempt and
resume functions. Automatic time-sharing of parallel jobs will not be
supported. Automatic time-sharing of parallel jobs will not be
supported. Explicit node selection will be optionally specified as part of the
will job run and initiate job functions. An API for all functions would be
developed initially, followed by a  command-line tool utilizing the API. Future
enhancements could include constraining jobs to a specific CPU count or memory
size within a node, which could be used to space-share the node.

System specific scripts can be executed prior to the initiation of a user job
and after the termination of a user job (e.g. prolog and epilog). These scripts
can be used to establish an appropriate environment for the user (e.g. permit
logins, disable logins, terminate "orphan" processes, etc.). 

\subsection{Scheduling}

We propose that all scheduling decisions be relegated to DPCS. DPCS has
sophisticated and flexible scheduling algorithms that suit our needs well and
provide the scalability required for this application. Most of the resource
accounting and some of the job management functions presently within DPCS would
be moved into the proposed SLURM Job Management and Job Status components. 

DPCS will require some modification to operate within this new, richer
environment. The DPCS Central Manager would also require porting to Linux. It
would be simple for other schedulers including Maui, PBS, LSF, and Globus 
to operate on the SLURM infrastructure, if so desired. It may in fact be 
desirable to create a very simple batch system for some customers.

The DPCS writes job accounting records to Unix files. Presently, these are
moved to a machine with the Sybase database. This data can be accessed via
command-line and web interfaces with Kerberos authentication and authorization.
We are not contemplating making this database software available through SLURM,
but might consider writing this data to an open source database if so desired.

\subsection{Slurmd}

\subsection{Command Line Utilities}

\subsection{Infrastructure: Communications Library}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centerline{\epsfig{file=LCM.communicate.eps,scale=0.5}}
\caption{Sample communications with fanout = 2}
\label{communicate}
\end{figure}
Optimal communications performance will depend upon hierarchical communications
patterned after DPCS and GangLL work. The SLURM control machine will generate a
list of nodes for each communication. The message will then be sent to one of
the nodes. 
The daemon on that node receiving the message will divide the node list into
two or more new lists of similar size and retransmit the message to one node on
each list. Figure~\ref{communicate} shows the communications for a fan-out of 
two.  Acknowledgements will optionally be sent for the messages to confirm 
receipt with a third message to commit the action. Our design permits the 
control machine to delegate one or more compute machine daemons as responsible 
for fault-tolerance, collection of acknowledgement messages, and the commit
decision. This design minimizes the control machine overhead for performance
reasons. This design also offers excellent scalability and fault 
tolerance.\footnote{Arguments to the communications request include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Request ID
\item Request (command or acknowledgement or commit)
\item List of nodes to be effected
\item Fan-out (count)
\item Commit of request to be required (Yes or No or Delegate node receiving
      message) 
\item Acknowledgement requested to node (name of node or NULL)
\item Acknowledgement requested to port (number)
\end{itemize} }

Security will be provided by the use of reserved ports, which must be opened by
root-level processes. SLURM daemons will open these ports and all user requests
will be processed through those daemons. 

\subsection{Infrastructure: Other}

The state of control machine daemons will be written periodically both to local
and global file systems to provide fault tolerance. Failures of control machine
daemons will result in their restart by the overlord with state recovery from
disk. If the control machine itself becomes inoperative, its functions can
easily be moved in an automated fashion to another computer. In fact, the
computer designated as alternative control machine can easily be relocated as
the workload on the compute nodes changes. The communications library design is
very important in providing this flexibility.

A single machine will serve as a centralized cluster manager and database. We
do not anticipate user applications executing on this machine. 

The syslog tools will be used for logging purposes and take advantage of the 
severity level parameter.

\section{Development Plan}

The design calls for a four-phase development process.  Phase one will
develop infrastructure: the communications layer, node status information 
collection and management.  There will be no development of a scheduler 
in phase one.

Phase two will provide basic job management functionality:  basic job and 
partition management plus simple scheduling, but without use of an
interconnect. 

Phase three will add Quadrics Elan3 switch support and overall documentation.  

Phase four rounds out SLURM with job accounting, fault-tolerance, 
and full integration with DPCS (Distributed Production Control System).


\section{Costs}

Very preliminary effort estimates are provided below. More research should
still be performed to investigate the availability of open source code. More
design work is also required to establish more accurate effort estimates.
