"[SLURM is the] coolest thing since the invention of UNIX...
We now can control who can log into [compute nodes] or at least can control
which ones to allow logging into.  This will be a tremendous help for users
who are developing their apps."<br><br>

"Today our largest IBM computers, BlueGene/L and Purple, ranked #1 and #3 
respectively on the November 2005 Top500 list, use SLURM.
This decision reduces large job launch times from tens of minutes to seconds.
This effectivley provides 
us with millions of dollars with of additional compute resources without 
additional cost.  It also allows our computational scientists to use their 
time more effectively.  SLURM is scalable to very large numbers of processors, 
another essential ingredient for use at LLNL. This means larger computer 
systems can be used than otherwise possible with a commensurate increase in 
the scale of problems that can be solved. SLURM's scalability has eliminated 
resource management from being a concern for computers of any foreseeable 
size."<br><br>

"SLURM has been adopted as the parallel allocation infrastructure used 
in HP's premier cluster stack, XC System Software. SLURM has permitted 
easy scaling of parallel applications on custer systems with thousands
of processors, and has also proven itself to be highly portable and 
efficient between interconnects icluding Quadrics, QsNet, Myrinet, 
Infiniband and Gigabit Ethernet."

"The new system provides us with greater capacity to run high performance
message passing parallel applications.  We are very happy with the 
performance of the system and the integration of components provided in 
the HP XC cluster software."<br>
