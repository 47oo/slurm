For system administrators:

Mostly for users:

SLURM state files in version 2.2 are different from those of version 2.1.
After installing SLURM version 2.2, plan to restart without preserving
jobs or other state information. While SLURM version 2.1 is still running,
cancel all pending and running jobs (e.g.
"scancel --state=pending; scancel --state=running"). Then stop and restart
daemons with the "-c" option or use "/etc/init.d/slurm startclean".
