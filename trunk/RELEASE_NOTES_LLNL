LLNL CHAOS-SPECIFIC RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 2.2
05 January 2010

This lists only the most significant changes from SLURM v2.1 to v2.2
with respect to Chaos systems. See the file RELEASE_NOTES for other
changes.

For system administrators:

Mostly for users:

SLURM state files in version 2.2 are different from those of version 2.1.
After installing SLURM version 2.2, plan to restart without preserving
jobs or other state information. While SLURM version 2.1 is still running,
cancel all pending and running jobs (e.g.
"scancel --state=pending; scancel --state=running"). Then stop and restart
daemons with the "-c" option or use "/etc/init.d/slurm startclean".

We have given Operators, Administrators, and bank account Coordinators
(as defined in the SLURM db) the ability to invoke commands that
view/modify user jobs and reservations.  Previously, one had to be
root to invoke "scontrol update JobId" for example.  In addition,
Administrators have the ability to view/modify node and partition info
without having to become root.  For more details, see AUTHORIZATION
section of the man pages for the following commands: scontrol,
scancel, and sbcast.
