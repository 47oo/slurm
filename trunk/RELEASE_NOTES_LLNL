LLNL CHAOS-SPECIFIC RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 2.1
16 October 2009

This lists only the most significant changes from SLURM v2.0 to v2.1
with respect to Chaos systems. See the file RELEASE_NOTES for other
changes.

For system administrators:
* The pam_slurm Pluggable Authentication Module for SLURM previously
  distributed separately has been moved within the main SLURM distribution
  and is packaged as a separate RPM.
* Configuration parameter MaxTasksPerNode has been added to control how many 
  tasks that the slurmd can launch.
* Added command "sacctmgr show problems" to display problems in the accounting 
  database (e.g. accounts with no users, users with no UID, etc.).

Mostly for users:
* Added -"-signal=<int>@<time>" option to salloc, sbatch and srun commands to
  notify programs before reaching the end of their time limit.
* Added a --detail option to "scontrol show job" to display the cpu/memory
  allocation informaton on a node-by-node basis.
* Add new job wait reason, ReqNodeNotAvail: Required node is not available 
  (down or drained).

SLURM state files in version 2.1 are different from those of version 2.1.
After installing SLURM version 2.1, plan to restart without preserving 
jobs or other state information. While SLURM version 2.0 is still running, 
cancel all pending and running jobs (e.g.
"scancel --state=pending; scancel --state=running"). Then stop and restart 
daemons with the "-c" option or use "/etc/init.d/slurm startclean".
